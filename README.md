# Interactive-Photo

The graphics in this photo move constantly and perform specific functions depending on your input. The head of each frog rocks back and forth and the clouds move in the background 
automatically. Once the window detects the mouse pointer in the window, some frogs begin to have multiple motions, making the image interactive. Moving the mouse horizontally will 
make the frog at the top left move diagonally from a rock. Vertically will cause a frog to move up and down from a lily pad. Holding the left mouse button will close the eyelids 
of a frog and cause another to stick out its tongue. Holding the right mouse button will enlarge another frog slowly but indefinitely. The image was programmed in Processing, 
which uses structured shapes to create the image.
